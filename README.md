# Multi-Signature Wallet

A robust, upgradeable **multi-signature wallet** smart contract built with Solidity. Designed for secure, decentralized management of funds by multiple owners.

---

## Key Features
- **Multi-Owner Governance:** Transactions require multiple owner approvals before execution.
- **Secure Transaction Flow:** Owners can submit, confirm, revoke, and execute transactions safely.
- **Transparent Auditing:** Events emitted for all critical actions for easy tracking and integration.
- **Flexibility:** Customizable number of required confirmations during deployment.

## Contract Overview

| Component | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Owners** | List of authorized wallet controllers. |
| **Transactions** | Struct containing recipient address, amount, call data, and execution status. |
| **Confirmations** | Mapping to track which owners have approved each transaction. |
| **Modifiers** | Role-based access control and transaction state validation. |
| **Events** | For submission, confirmation, execution, and revocation of transactions. |

---

## Core Functions

- `submitTransaction(address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data)`
- `confirmTransaction(uint256 txIndex)`
- `executeTransaction(uint256 txIndex)`
- `revokeConfirmation(uint256 txIndex)`

Each function is protected with appropriate access control to ensure wallet integrity.

## How to Deploy

1. Clone this repository.
2. Deploy the contract with:
   - **Owners array** (at least one address, no duplicates)
   - **Required confirmations** (at least 1, not more than the number of owners)

**Example constructor parameters:**
```plaintext
owners: [0xOwner1, 0xOwner2, 0xOwner3]
requiredConfirmations: 2
```

3. Use Foundry, Hardhat, or Remix for testing and deployment.

---

## Security Best Practices
- Owners must be fully trusted parties.
- Critical transactions should require high confirmation thresholds.
- Consider implementing time locks and owner update mechanisms for production environments.

---

## Potential Enhancements
- Owner addition and removal.
- Transaction expiration timestamps.
- Gas optimization techniques for large owner groups.
- Front-end dApp integration.

---

## Tech Stack
- Solidity ^0.8.x
- Foundry / Hardhat for testing and deployment
- OpenZeppelin (optional security enhancements)
